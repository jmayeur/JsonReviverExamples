JsonReviverExamples
===================

Discovery App, trying to get a handle on JSON Revivers - based on this StackOverFlow
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8111446/turning-json-strings-into-objects-with-methods

- my goal is to start with this generic reviver approach and evolve it to something that can
handle more complex situations.


Quick start
=====

1. Clone this repo
2. Exec npm install && bower install
3. Exec karma start karma.conf.js


Purpose
====
Just playing around with JSON Revivers - trying to make sure I understand how they work (and reading the source code).
